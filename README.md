# CardCreationForTheKeeper
Card Creation helper for the game https://github.com/kotc-game/kotc

Of course very embryonic at this point.
Text and cost can be generated with the current code (cf example.py).
Next steps are (in around that order) :
- add documentation
- fill data from componentHistory.md 
- translate in French
- replace eval with an arithmetic parser
- make it able to read lists of cards. encode decks
- convert to command line tool
- make version checker who replaces components with their revisions
- make svg card templates and convert to "bare card" creator
